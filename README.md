# Waybar Modules

I switched to wayland ([riverwm](https://codeberg.org/river/river)) and [waybar](https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar/) from bspwm and polybar for Xorg but wanted a similar experience on the desktop. Here is a personal collection of waybar-modules that I use on my own machines and will add to if I create more. 

This directory contains a `.venv` for any of the scripts that use python and each subdirectory contains the code and example waybar config to use the particular feature.

Hope you find some of them useful, would love to get your improvements or ideas!
